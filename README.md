# AI-Powered Waste Sorting & Recycling Assistant

Photo-based household waste classification with region-specific disposal rules and recycling-rate analytics.

Capstone project, Compact Programming Course (Python), FH Dortmund, WS 2026/27.

**Problem:** people don't know which bin an item belongs in, and municipalities don't know their recycling rates.
